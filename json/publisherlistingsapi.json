    "description": "# Integration Overview\nThis section helps you understand how your site becomes integrated with Yext and what we need from you during the implementation process. Depending on the type of integration you are setting up, some sections may not apply.\n\n## Integration Process\nWhen you decide to become a Yext Listings publisher, you can expect the implementation process to unfold as follows:\nYext sends you a pre-implementation questionnaire. After we receive your completed questionnaire, we set up a kick-off call with you to more thoroughly explain the implementation process and answer any questions you may have.\n\nYour team builds the required APIs and delivers them to Yext one at time, along with other required materials, in this order:\n* **Categories**\n* **SEARCH API**\n* **DETAILS API**\n* **ORDER API**\n* **UPDATE API**\n* **CANCEL API**\n* **SUPPRESS API**\n* **REVIEWS API**\n* **SUGGESTIONS API**\n* **CSS Selectors**\n\nYour team will also build around the following Yext APIs for accessing Enhanced Conent lists, sending webhook notifications, and providing analytics:\n* **[GET LIST API](https://hitchhikers.yext.com/publisherapis/publishertrackingpixelapi)**\n* **[NOTIFY API](https://hitchhikers.yext.com/publisherapis/publishernotifyreviewapi)**\n* **[TRACKING PIXEL API](https://hitchhikers.yext.com/publisherapis/publishereclapi)**\n\n\nAfter Yext receives each API, we test it and give you feedback as soon as possible.\n* One of our engineers does cursory testing to determine if the API is functional.\n* A member of our Operations team then conducts more thorough testing to ensure the API is working correctly.\n* When all integration points are completed, Yext completes stress testing using real data, which helps to ensure that we can add many locations at once without issue.\n* After each launch, we share any issues we encountered. These issues must be resolved before attempting the next launch.\n* When all launches pass, we begin to add all Yext businesses to your site through the APIs.\n\nFor required API fields, please refer to the Data Formats section below.\n\n## Security Measures\nTo ensure the integrity of your integration, we have put the following security measures in place and are enforcing them for all API requests sent to or from Yext.\n\n### HTTPS\nHTTPS connections are **required** when sending API requests or responses.\n\n### Secure IDs\n\n**You must provide Yext with at least one of the following methods** to authenticate our connection to your system:\n* Basic authentication with login credentials that you specify\n* API keys\n\nAuthentication should be implemented so they can be easily updated/refreshed upon Yext’s request, as our team will refresh these credentials from time to time.\n\n### IP Filtering\nUsing IP address filtering as a security measure is **required** when integrating with Yext.\nYext uses a static set of IP addresses when sending API requests to your system that you can use to configure our access to your databases. The full list of IP addresses will be provided by your TPM.\n\n## Rate Limits\nIn order to ensure an optimal user experience for both businesses and consumers, we ask all publishers to meet the requirements outlined in the table below.\n\n| Requirement      | Description |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| <p>You must allow Yext to issue 700,000 queries per day and up to 12 QPS.</p>      | <p>Three API endpoints in particular need to support high volume:</p> <p><ul><li>SEARCH and DETAILS</li><li>UPDATE, since large customers can generate many updates by bulk-editing their locations</li></ul></p>       |\n| <p>You must not block Yext from scraping your property, including SERP and profile pages.</p>   | <p>Yext takes screenshots of listings when they go live, which can result in many thousands of page views per day. You may want to filter those page views from other purposes (e.g., in order to not charge advertisers for Yext page views). </p> <p>Our requests will always originate from the Yext IP addresses.</p>       |\n\n\n### Volume\nYext will generally not send more than the following for each endpoint:\n* Search/Details/Reviews - 7 QPS or 500K requests per day collectively\n* Order/Update/Cancel - 5 QPS or 200K requests per day collectively\n\nEach API is designed for a particular set of users.\n\n## Design Guidelines\n\n| Field Type                    | Specifications |\n| -----------                   | ----------- |\n| Business name                 | <p><ul><li>You should be able to accommodate at least 100 characters.</li><li>You should respect the spelling and capitalization that we pass to you (e.g., the first letter may not always be capitalized).</li></ul></p>|\n| Business address              | <p><ul><li>The business address fields should be displayed in the correct order based on the country of the location.</li><li>If a `displayAddress` value is provided for the address, it should be shown after `address2` and before `city`.</li><li>If `address.visible` is `false`, hide only `address` and `address2` on the listing and on the SERP.</li></ul></p>       |\n| Phone numbers                 | <p><ul><li>All phone numbers should be formatted according to local conventions, without the country code.</li><li>You should able to support all of the following types of phone numbers and label them as specified by Yext:</li><ul><li>Main Phone</li><li>Alternate Phone</li><li>Fax</li><li>Mobile</li><li>Toll-Free</li><li>TTY</li></ul><li>The Main Phone number must appear at the top of the listing and should not be repeated at the bottom of the listing in an \"Additional Phone Numbers\" section.</li><li>An \"Additional Phone Numbers\" section should only appear if we provide you with additional types of phone numbers (Alternate Phone, Fax, etc.).</li></ul></p>       |\n| Map marker                    | <p><ul><li>The location's map marker should be updated based on the latitude and longitude provided by Yext.</li><li>If `address.visible` is `false`, complete one of the following options both on the listing and on the SERP.</li><ul><li>completely remove the map from the listing or SERP</li><li>hide the map marker</li><li>move the map marker to the center of the location's city</li></ul><li>You must also ensure that the location's address is not in the listing page's source code and is not visible to search engines.</li></ul></p>      |\n| Featured Message              | <p><ul><li>The Featured Message text should be highlighted in some way (i.e., a box around it, shaded background, or both).</li><li>The text should be preceded by a special icon.

displaying the most up-to-date data.  In order for us to successfully scan your site's listings, we ask that you assign specific CSS selector names to each field you support.\n\nYou may choose different names for each field, but please inform us of the selector names. In addition, you may use CSS selectors that already exist as long as they are unique. Please use the same set of CSS selector names for both Yext-powered listings and listings that are in your site’s default format.\n"

You should include all fields that we pass to you in your listing. Once Yext has successfully sent an ORDER request, the listing content should be “locked”, preventing non-Yext updates to the Yext-updated fields. \n* Like all of the other real-time API methods, while the ORDER operation uses the POST method, it actually needs to be idempotent for a given yextId. \n* In the event that a ORDER acknowledgment gets lost, Yext will retry the ORDER operation, which may create duplicates in your index. Therefore, if Yext sends two consecutive ORDER commands using the same yextId, you should re-use the generated id from the first ORDER operation (i.e., you must not create a duplicate listing). \n* If we send an ORDER request for a listing that has already been claimed by Yext (i.e., the listing's yextId is associated with an id in your system), you should treat the ORDER as an UPDATE and respond accordingly.\n* For a full list of fields available, including those specific to healthcare and hotels, please reach out to your Yext partner manager or pubops-team@yext.com\n",
