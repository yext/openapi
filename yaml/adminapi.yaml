        Request that a new location be added and services added to it. The
        location is created only if the "status" field returned is "COMPLETE".
        In most cases, the "status" returned in the Add Request: Create response
        will be "SUBMITTED". For a list and explanation of each possible
        "status", please see the [**Add Requests: Get
        (Location)**](#operation/getAddRequest) section.


        To receive real-time updates on the status of your Add Request, we
        recommend that you configure the [**Add Request Update:
        Webhook**](../webhooks/index.html#operation/addRequestWebhook) in the
        Developer Console (see the [**Configure
        Webhooks**](http://developer.yext.com/docs/guides/configure-webhooks/)
        guide for more information). Alternatively, use the [**Add Requests: Get
        (Location)**](#operation/getAddRequest) call to determine the current
        Add Request "status".

                Contains the daily access hours, holiday access hours, and
                reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `accessHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday access hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily drive-through hours, holiday drive-through
                hours, and reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `driveThroughHours`.
                (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per
                day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday drive-through hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily hours, holiday hours, and reopen date for the
                Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `hours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday hours are represented by the `holidayHours`
                sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                IDs must be valid and selectable (i.e., cannot be parent

                NOTE: The list of category IDs that you send us must be
                comprehensive. For example, if you send us a list of IDs that
                does not include IDs that you sent in your last update, Yext
                considers the missing categories to be deleted, and we remove
                them from your listings.

                Valid keywords (e.g., `has_drive_through`, `has_fitting_room`,
                `kitchen_in_room`) are determined by the entity's primary

                Google Fields: List endpoint.


                Keyword values provide more details on how the keyword applies
                to the entity (e.g., if the keyword is `has_drive_through`, its
                values may be `true` or `false`).

                Contains the daily access hours, holiday access hours, and
                reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `accessHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday access hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                The unique IDs of the entity's Google My Business keywords, as
                well as the unique IDs of any values selected for each keyword.


                Valid keywords (e.g., `has_drive_through`, `has_fitting_room`,
                `kitchen_in_room`) are determined by the entity's primary
                category. A full list of keywords can be retrieved with the
                Google Fields: List endpoint.


                Keyword values provide more details on how the keyword applies
                to the entity (e.g., if the keyword is `has_drive_through`, its
                values may be `true` or `false`).


                * If the **`v`** parameter is before `20181204`:
                **`googleAttributes`** is formatted as a map of key-value pairs
                (e.g., `[{ "id": "has_wheelchair_accessible_entrance", "values":
                [ "true" ] }]`)

                * If the **`v`** parameter is on or after `20181204`: the
                contents are formatted as a list of objects (e.g., `{
                "has_wheelchair_accessible_entrance": [ "true" ]}`)


                **NOTE:** The latest Google Attributes are available via the
                Google Fields: List endpoint. Google Attributes are managed by
                Google and are subject to change without notice. To prevent
                errors, make sure your API implementation is not dependent on
                the presence of specific attributes.

                Contains the daily hours, holiday hours, and reopen date for the

                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `hours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday hours are represented by the `holidayHours`
                sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily online service hours, holiday online service
                hours, and reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `onlineServiceHours`.
                (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per
                day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday online service hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily pickup hours, holiday pickup hours, and
                reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `pickupHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday pickup hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                hours, and reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `onlineServiceHours`.
                (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per
                day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday online service hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily access hours, holiday access hours, and

                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `accessHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday access hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily brunch hours, holiday brunch hours, and
                reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `brunchHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday brunch hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Location Descriptors are used for Enterprise businesses that
                sync Facebook listings using brand page location structure. The

                description (e.g. geomodifier) that will appear in parentheses
                after the name on the Facebook listing.

                date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `happyHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday happy hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily hours, holiday hours, and reopen date for the
                Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `hours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday hours are represented by the `holidayHours`
                sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily kitchen hours, holiday kitchen hours, and
                reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `kitchenHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday kitchen hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                The unique IDs of the entity's Google My Business keywords, as
                well as the unique IDs of any values selected for each keyword.


                Valid keywords (e.g., `has_drive_through`, `has_fitting_room`,
                `kitchen_in_room`) are determined by the entity's primary
                category. A full list of keywords can be retrieved with the
                Google Fields: List endpoint.


                Keyword values provide more details on how the keyword applies
                to the entity (e.g., if the keyword is `has_drive_through`, its
                values may be `true` or `false`).


                * If the **`v`** parameter is before `20181204`:
                **`googleAttributes`** is formatted as a map of key-value pairs
                (e.g., `[{ "id": "has_wheelchair_accessible_entrance", "values":
                [ "true" ] }]`)

                * If the **`v`** parameter is on or after `20181204`: the
                contents are formatted as a list of objects (e.g., `{
                "has_wheelchair_accessible_entrance": [ "true" ]}`)


                **NOTE:** The latest Google Attributes are available via the

                Google and are subject to change without notice. To prevent
                errors, make sure your API implementation is not dependent on
                the presence of specific attributes.

                Contains the daily access hours, holiday access hours, and
                reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `accessHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday access hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily brunch hours, holiday brunch hours, and
                reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `brunchHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday brunch hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `deliveryHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday delivery hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily drive-through hours, holiday drive-through
                hours, and reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `driveThroughHours`.
                (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per
                day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday drive-through hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily happy hours, holiday happy hours, and reopen
                date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `happyHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday happy hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

              description: >-
                Contains the daily hours, holiday hours, and reopen date for the
                Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `hours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday hours are represented by the `holidayHours`
                sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily kitchen hours, holiday kitchen hours, and
                reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `kitchenHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday kitchen hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily online service hours, holiday online service
                hours, and reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `onlineServiceHours`.
                (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per
                day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday online service hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily pickup hours, holiday pickup hours, and
                reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `pickupHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday pickup hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                              (e.g., `"06:30"`, `"17:00"`).
                      description: >-
                        Contains the time intervals for the Entity's senior
                        hours on Wednesday. Note that if isClosed is set to

              description: >-
                Contains the daily senior hours, holiday senior hours, and
                reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `seniorHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday senior hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily takeout hours, holiday takeout hours, and
                reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `takeoutHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday takeout hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily access hours, holiday access hours, and
                reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `accessHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday access hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily brunch hours, holiday brunch hours, and
                reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `brunchHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday brunch hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily delivery hours, holiday delivery hours, and
                reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `deliveryHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday delivery hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily drive-through hours, holiday drive-through
                hours, and reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `driveThroughHours`.
                (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per
                day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday drive-through hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `happyHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday happy hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                        Contains the time intervals for which the Entity is open
                        on Wednesday. Note that if isClosed is set to true,
                        "openIntervals" cannot be provided in an update.
              description: >-
                Contains the daily hours, holiday hours, and reopen date for the
                Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `hours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday hours are represented by the `holidayHours`
                sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily kitchen hours, holiday kitchen hours, and
                reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `kitchenHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday kitchen hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

              description: >-
                Contains the daily online service hours, holiday online service
                hours, and reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `onlineServiceHours`.
                (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per
                day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday online service hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily pickup hours, holiday pickup hours, and
                reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `pickupHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday pickup hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Contains the daily senior hours, holiday senior hours, and
                reopen date for the Entity.


                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `seniorHours`. (e.g.
                `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
                through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                Similarly, holiday senior hours are represented by the
                `holidayHours` sub-field.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business
                is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                SPECIAL CASES:

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `takeoutHours`. (e.g.

                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business

                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day,
                set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that
                day.

                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day
                (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to
                5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with
                non-overlapping sets of hours.

                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set
                `isClosed` to true for that day.

            Hours should be submitted as a comma-separated list of days, where
            each day's hours are specified as follows:


            d:oh:om:ch:cm

            * d = day of the week –
              * 1 – Sunday
              * 2 – Monday
              * 3 – Tuesday
              * 4 – Wednesday
              * 5 – Thursday
              * 6 – Friday
              * 7 – Saturday
            * oh:om = opening time in 24-hour format

            * ch:cm = closing time in 24-hour format


            Times with single-digit hours (e.g., 9 AM) can be submitted with or
            without a leading zero (9:00 or 09:00).


            **Example:** open 9 AM to 5 PM Monday and Tuesday, open 10 AM to 4
            PM on Saturday – 2:9:00:17:00,3:9:00:17:00,7:10:00:16:00


            SPECIAL CASES:

            * To indicate that a location is open 24 hours on a specific day,
            set 00:00 as both the opening and closing time for that day.
              * **Example:** open all day on Saturdays – 7:00:00:00:00
            * To indicate that a location is closed on a specific day, omit that
            day from the list or set it as closed ("closed" is not case
            sensitive).
              * **Example:** closed on Sundays – 1:closed
              * **NOTE:** If a location is closed seven days a week, set at least one day to closed. Otherwise, **hours** is an empty string, and we assume you are not submitting hours information for that location.
            * To indicate that a location has split hours on a specific day,
            submit a set of hours for each block of time the location is open.
              * **Example:** open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM on Mondays – 2:9:00:12:00,2:13:00:17:00

            **NOTE:** To set hours for specific days of the year rather than
            days of the week, use **holidayHours**.

          description: >-
            Contains the daily access hours, holiday access hours, and reopen
            date for the Entity.


            Each day is represented by a sub-field of `accessHours`. (e.g.
            `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
            through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

            Similarly, holiday access hours are represented by the
            `holidayHours` sub-field.

            Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is
            temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

            SPECIAL CASES:

            * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set
            start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.

            * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day (e.g.,
            open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM),
            supply up to two `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of
            hours.

            * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed`
            to true for that day.

            Contains the daily brunch hours, holiday brunch hours, and reopen
            date for the Entity.


            Each day is represented by a sub-field of `brunchHours`. (e.g.
            `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
            through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

            Similarly, holiday brunch hours are represented by the
            `holidayHours` sub-field.

            Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is
            temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

            SPECIAL CASES:

            * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set
            start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.

            * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day (e.g.,
            open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM),
            supply up to two `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of
            hours.

            * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed`
            to true for that day.

            Contains the daily delivery hours, holiday delivery hours, and
            reopen date for the Entity.


            Each day is represented by a sub-field of `deliveryHours`. (e.g.
            `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
            through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

            Similarly, holiday delivery hours are represented by the
            `holidayHours` sub-field.

            Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is
            temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

            SPECIAL CASES:

            * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set
            start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.

            * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day (e.g.,
            open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM),
            supply up to two `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of
            hours.

            * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed`
            to true for that day.

            Contains the daily drive-through hours, holiday drive-through hours,
            and reopen date for the Entity.


            Each day is represented by a sub-field of `driveThroughHours`. (e.g.
            `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
            through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

            Similarly, holiday drive-through hours are represented by the
            `holidayHours` sub-field.

            Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is
            temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

            SPECIAL CASES:

            * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set
            start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.

            * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day (e.g.,
            open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM),
            supply up to two `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of
            hours.

            * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed`
            to true for that day.

            Contains the daily happy hours, holiday happy hours, and reopen date
            for the Entity.


            Each day is represented by a sub-field of `happyHours`. (e.g.
            `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
            through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

            Similarly, holiday happy hours are represented by the `holidayHours`
            sub-field.

            Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is
            temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

            SPECIAL CASES:

            * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set
            start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.

            * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day (e.g.,
            open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM),
            supply up to two `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of
            hours.

            * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed`
            to true for that day.

            Contains the daily hours, holiday hours, and reopen date for the
            Entity.


            Each day is represented by a sub-field of `hours`. (e.g. `monday`,
            `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the
            `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

            Similarly, holiday hours are represented by the `holidayHours`
            sub-field.

            Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is
            temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

            SPECIAL CASES:

            * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set
            start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.

            * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day (e.g.,
            open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM),
            supply up to two `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of
            hours.

            * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed`
            to true for that day.

            date for the Entity.


            Each day is represented by a sub-field of `kitchenHours`. (e.g.
            `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
            through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

            Similarly, holiday kitchen hours are represented by the
            `holidayHours` sub-field.

            Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is
            temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

            SPECIAL CASES:

            * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set
            start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.

            * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day (e.g.,
            open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM),
            supply up to two `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of
            hours.

            * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed`
            to true for that day.

            hours, and reopen date for the Entity.


            Each day is represented by a sub-field of `onlineServiceHours`.
            (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
            through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

            Similarly, holiday online service hours are represented by the
            `holidayHours` sub-field.

            Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is
            temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

            SPECIAL CASES:

            * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set
            start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.

            * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day (e.g.,
            open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM),
            supply up to two `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of
            hours.

            * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed`
            to true for that day.

            Contains the daily pickup hours, holiday pickup hours, and reopen
            date for the Entity.


            Each day is represented by a sub-field of `pickupHours`. (e.g.
            `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
            through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

            Similarly, holiday pickup hours are represented by the
            `holidayHours` sub-field.

            Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is
            temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

            SPECIAL CASES:

            * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set
            start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.

            * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day (e.g.,
            open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM),
            supply up to two `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of
            hours.

            * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed`
            to true for that day.

            Contains the daily senior hours, holiday senior hours, and reopen
            date for the Entity.


            Each day is represented by a sub-field of `seniorHours`. (e.g.
            `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
            through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

            Similarly, holiday senior hours are represented by the
            `holidayHours` sub-field.

            Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is
            temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

            SPECIAL CASES:

            * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set
            start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.

            * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day (e.g.,
            open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM),
            supply up to two `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of
            hours.

            * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed`
            to true for that day.

            Contains the daily takeout hours, holiday takeout hours, and reopen
            date for the Entity.


            Each day is represented by a sub-field of `takeoutHours`. (e.g.
            `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day
            through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

            Similarly, holiday takeout hours are represented by the
            `holidayHours` sub-field.

            Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is
            temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

            SPECIAL CASES:

            * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set
            start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.

            * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day (e.g.,
            open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM),
            supply up to two `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of
            hours.

            * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed`
            to true for that day.
