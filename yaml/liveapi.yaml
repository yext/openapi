            This parameter represents one or more filtering conditions that are applied to the set of entities that would otherwise be returned. This parameter should be provided as a URL-encoded string containing a JSON object.

            For example, if the filter JSON is `{"name":{"$eq":"John"}}`, then the filter param after URL-encoding will be: `filter=%7B%22name%22%3A%7B%22%24eq%22%3A%22John%22%7D%7D`

            **Basic Filter Structure**

            The filter object at its core consists of a *matcher*, a *field*, and an *argument*.

            For example, in the following filter JSON:

            ```
            {
              "name":{
                "$eq":"John"
              }
            }
            ```

            `$eq` is the *matcher*, or filtering operation (equals, in this example),

            `name` is the *field* being filtered by, and

            `John` is *value* to be matched against.

            **Combining Multiple Filters**

            Multiple filters can be combined into one object using *combinators*. For example, the following filter JSON combines multiple filters using the combinator `$and`. `$or` is also supported.
            ```
            {
              "$and":[
                {
                  "firstName":{
                    "$eq":"John"
                  }
                },
                {
                  "countryCode":{
                    "$in":[
                      "US",
                      "GB"
                    ]
                  }
                }
              ]
            }
            ```

            **Filter Negation**

            Certain filter types may be negated. For example:

            ```
            {
              "$not" {
                "name":{
                  "$eq":"John"
                }
              }
            }
            ```

            This can also be written more simply with a `!` in the `$eq` parameter. The following filter would have the same effect:

            ```
            {
              "name":{
                "!$eq":"John"
              }
            }
            ```

            **Filter Complement**

            You can also search for the complement of a filter. This filter would match entities that do not contain "hello" in their descriptions, or do not have a description set. This is different from negation which can only match entities who have the negated field set to something.

            ```
            {
              "$complement":{
                "description":{
                  "$contains":"hello"
                }
              }
            }
            ```

            **Addressing Subfields**

            Subfields of fields can be addressed using the "dot" notation while filtering. For example, if you have a custom field called **`c_myCustomField`**:

            ```
            {
              "c_myCustomField":{
                "age": 30,
                "name": "Jim",
              }
            }
            ```

            While filtering, subfields may be addressed using the "dot" notation.

            ```
            {
              "c_myCustomField.name":{
                "!$eq":"John"
              }
            }
            ```

            Fields that are nested deeper may be addressed using dot notation, as well. For example, if **`name`** in the above example was a compound field with two subfields **`first`** and **`last`**, **`first`** may be addressed as **`c_myCustomField.name.first`**.

            **Field Support**

            Entity fields correspond to certain filter types, which support matchers. Going by the example above, the field **`name`** supports the `TEXT` filter type, which supports `$eq` (equals) and `$startsWith` (starts with).

            **TEXT**

            The `TEXT` filter type is supported for text fields. (e.g., **`name`**, **`countryCode`**)

            <table style="width:100%">
              <tr>
                <th>Matcher</th>
                <th>Details</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$eq (equals)</th>
                <th>

                {
                  "countryCode":{
                    "$eq":"US"
                  }
                },
                {
                  "countryCode":{
                    "!$eq":"US"
                  }
                }

              Supports negation. Case insensitive.
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$startsWith</th>
                <th>

              Matches if the field starts with the argument value.

              e.g., "Amazing" starts with "amaz"

                {
                   "address.line1":{
                      "$startsWith": "Jo"
                   }
                }

              Supports negation. Case insensitive.
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$in</th>
                <th>

              Matches if field value is a member of the argument list.

                {
                  "firstName":{
                    "$in": ["John", "Jimmy"]
                  }
                }

              Does not support negation. Negation can be mimicked by using an "OR" matcher, for example:

                {
                  "$and":[
                    {
                      "firstName":{
                        "!$eq": "John"
                      }
                    },
                    {
                      "firstName":{
                        "!$eq": "Jimmy"
                      }
                    }
                  ]
                }

              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$contains</th>
                <th>

                {
                  "c_myString":{
                    "$contains":"sample"
                  }
                }

              This filter will match if "sample" is contained in any string within **`c_myString`**.

              Note that this matching is "left-edge n-gram", meaning the argument string must be the beginning of a token. The string "sample" will match strings like "This a sample", "Sample one", and "Sample 2", but not strings like "thisisasamplewithoutspaces".

              Supports negation.
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$containsAny</th>
                <th>

                {
                  "c_myString":{
                    "$containsAny":[
                      "sample1", "sample2"
                    ]
                  }
                }

              This filter will match if either "sample1" or "sample2" is contained in any string within **`c_myString`**. The argument list can contain more than two strings.

              Note that this matching is "left-edge n-gram", meaning the argument string must be the beginning of a token. The string "sample" will match strings like "This a sample", "Sample one", and "Sample 2", but not strings like "thisisasamplewithoutspaces".

              Supports negation.
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$containsAll</th>
                <th>

                {
                  "c_myString":{
                    "$containsAll":[
                      "sample1",
                      "sample2"
                    ]
                  }
                }

              This filter will match if both "sample1" and "sample2" are contained in any string within **`c_myString`**. The argument list can contain more than two strings.

              Note that this matching is "left-edge n-gram", meaning the argument string must be the beginning of a token. The string "sample" will match strings like "This a sample", "Sample one", and "Sample 2", but not strings like "thisisasamplewithoutspaces".

              Supports negation.
              </tr>
            </table>

            **BOOLEAN**


            The BOOLEAN filter type is supported for boolean fields and Yes / No custom fields.
            <table style="width:100%">
              <tr>
                <th>Matcher</th>
                <th>Details</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$eq</th>
                <th>

                {
                  "isFreeEvent": {
                    "$eq": true
                  }
                }

              For booleans, the filter takes a boolean value, not a string.
              Supports negation.
              </tr>
            </table>

            **STRUCT**

            The STRUCT filter type is supported for compound fields with subfields.

            *e.g., **`address`**, **`featuredMessage`**, fields of custom types*

            <table style="width:100%">
              <tr>
                <th>Matcher</th>
                <th>Details</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$hasProperty</th>
                <th>

              Matches if argument is a key (subfield) of field being filtered by. This filter type is useful for filtering by compound fields or to check if certain fields have a value set.

                {
                  "address": {
                    "$hasProperty": "line1"
                  }
                }

              Note that if a given property of a compound field is not set, the filter will not match. For example, if `line1` of **`address`** is not set for an entity, then the above matcher will not match the entity.

              Supports negation.

              </tr>
            </table>

            **OPTION**

            The OPTION filter type is supported for options custom fields and fields that have a predetermined list of valid values.

             *e.g., **`eventStatus`**, **`gender`**, `SINGLE_OPTION` and `MULTI_OPTION` types of custom fields.*

            <table style="width:100%">
              <tr>
                <th>Matcher</th>
                <th>Details</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$eq</th>
                <th>

              Matching is case insensitive and insensitive to consecutive whitespace.

              e.g., "XYZ 123" matches "xyz       123"

                {
                  "eventStatus": {
                    "$eq": "SCHEDULED"
                  }
                }

              Supports negation. Negating `$eq` on the list will match any field that does not hold any of the provided values.

              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$in</th>
                <th>

                {
                  "eventStatus": {
                    "$in": [
                      "SCHEDULED",
                      "POSTPONED"
                    ]
                  }
                }

              Does not support negation. However, negation can be mimicked by using an `$and` matcher to negate individually over the desired values. For example:

                {
                  "$and": [
                    {
                      "eventStatus":{
                        "!$eq": "SCHEDULED"
                      }
                    },
                    {
                      "firstName":{
                        "!$eq": "POSTPONED"
                      }
                    }
                  ]
                }

              </tr>
            </table>

            **PHONE**

            The PHONE filter type is supported for phone number fields only. PHONE will support the same matchers as TEXT, except that for `$eq`, the same phone number with or without calling code will match.

            <table style="width:100%">
              <tr>
                <th>Matcher</th>
                <th>Details</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$eq</th>
                <th>

                {
                  "mainPhone":{
                    "$eq":"+18187076189"
                  }
                },
                {
                  "mainPhone":{
                    "$eq":"8187076189"
                  }
                },
                {
                  "mainPhone":{
                    "!$eq":"9177076189"
                  }
                }

              Supports negation. Case insensitive.

              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$startsWith</th>
                <th>

              Matches if the field starts with the argument value.

              e.g., "8187076189" starts with "818"

                {
                  "mainPhone":{

            **LIST OF STRUCT**

            Filtering on lists of struct types is a bit nuanced. Filtering can only be done on lists of structs of the SAME type.
            For example, if **`c_myStructList`** is a list of compound fields with the subfields **`age`** and **`name`**, then one can address the **`age`** properties of each field in **`c_myStructList`** as a flattened list of integers and filtering upon them. For example, the following filter:

            ```
            {
              "c_myStructList.age":{
                "$eq": 20
              }
            }
            ```

            will match if any field in the list has an **`age`** property equal to 20. Similarly, any filter that can be applied to lists of integers could be applied to **`age`** in this case (`$eq`, `$eqAll`, `$eqAny`).


            **HOURS**

            By filtering on an hours field, you can find which entities are open or closed at a specified time or during a certain time range. All of these filters also take an entity’s holiday hours and reopen date into account.

            **Filtering by Dates and Times**

            **Time zones**

            The filtering language supports searching both in local time and within a certain time zone. Searching in local time will simply ignore the time zone on the target entities, while providing one will convert the zone of your queried time to the zone of the target entities.

            To search in local time, simply provide the date or time without any zone: `2019-06-07T15:30` or `2019-06-07`.

            To conduct a zoned search, provide the name of the time zone in brackets after the time, as it is shown in the tz database: `2019-06-07T15:30[America/New_York]` or `2019-06-06[America/Phoenix]`.


            **Date and time types**

            In addition to searching with dates and datetimes, you can also query with years, months, and hours. For example, the filter:

            ```
            {
              "time.start": {
                "$eq": "2018"
              }
            }
            ```

            would match all start times in the year 2018. The same logic would apply for a month (`2019-05`), a date (`2019-05-01`), or an hour (`2019-05-01T06`).

            These types also work with ordered searches. For example:

            ```
            {
             "time.start": {
                "$lt": "2018"
             }
            }
            ```

            would match start times before 2018 (i.e., anything in 2017 or before). On the other hand, the same query with a `$le` matcher would include anything in or before 2018.

            **"Now" and Date Math**

            Instead of providing a static date or time, you can also use `now` in place of any date time. When you do so, the system will calculate the time when the query is made and conduct a zoned search.

            In order to search for a future or past time relative to `now`, you can use date math. For example, you can enter `now+3h` or `now-1d`, which would mean 3 hours from now and 1 day ago, respectively. You can also add and subtract minutes (`m`), months (`M`), and years (`y`).

            It is also possible to add or subtract time from a static date or datetime. Simply add `||` between the static value and any addition or subtraction. For example, `2019-02-03||+1d` would be the same as `2019-02-04`.

            You can also convert date and time types to other types. For example, to convert the datetime `2019-05-06T22:15` to a date, use `2019-05-06T22:15||/d`. Doing so would yield the same result as using `2019-05-06`. This method also works with `now`: `now/d` will give you today’s date without the time.

            **Filtering Across an Entity**

            It is possible to search for a specific text string across all fields of an entity by using the `$anywhere` matcher.

            <table style="width:100%">
              <tr>
                <th>Matcher</th>
                <th>Details</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$anywhere</th>
                <th>

              Matches if the argument text appears anywhere in the entity (including subfields, structs, and lists)

                {
                  "$anywhere": "hello"
                }

              This filter will match all entities that contain the string "hello" or strings that begin with "hello".

              </tr>
            </table>

            **Examples**

            The following filter will match against entities that:
            - Are of type `event` (note that entity types can also be filtered by the **`entityTypes`** query parameter)
            - Have a name that starts with the text "Century"
            - Have a maximum age between 10 and 20
            - Have a minimum age between 5 and 7
            - Start after 7 PM (19:00) on August 28, 2018

            ```
            {
              "$and":[
                {
                  "entityType":{
                    "$eq":"event"
                  }
                },
                {
                  "name":{
                    "$startsWith":"Century"
                  }
                },
                {

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `accessHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday access hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `brunchHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday brunch hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `deliveryHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday delivery hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                    For example, if the user sets the Facebook Call-to-Action as " 'Sign Up' using 'Website URL' " in the Yext platform, **`type`** will be `SIGN_UP` and **`value`** will be `[[websiteUrl]]`.

                                    The Call-to-Action will have the same behavior if the user sets the value to "Custom Value" in the platform and embeds a field.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `happyHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday happy hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `hours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `kitchenHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday kitchen hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Contains the daily online service hours, holiday online service hours, and reopen date for the Entity.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `onlineServiceHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday online service hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `pickupHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday pickup hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `seniorHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday senior hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `takeoutHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday takeout hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                          Contains the daily access hours, holiday access hours, and reopen date for the Entity.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `accessHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday access hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                          SPECIAL CASES:
                          * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `brunchHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday brunch hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `deliveryHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday delivery hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                          SPECIAL CASES:
                          * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                          Contains the daily drive-through hours, holiday drive-through hours, and reopen date for the Entity.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `driveThroughHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday drive-through hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                          SPECIAL CASES:
                          * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                              For example, if the user sets the Facebook Call-to-Action as " 'Sign Up' using 'Website URL' " in the Yext platform, **`type`** will be `SIGN_UP` and **`value`** will be `[[websiteUrl]]`.

                              The Call-to-Action will have the same behavior if the user sets the value to "Custom Value" in the platform and embeds a field.

                          Contains the daily happy hours, holiday happy hours, and reopen date for the Entity.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `happyHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday happy hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                          SPECIAL CASES:
                          * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `hours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                          SPECIAL CASES:
                          * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `kitchenHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday kitchen hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                          SPECIAL CASES:
                          * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                          Contains the daily online service hours, holiday online service hours, and reopen date for the Entity.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `onlineServiceHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday online service hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                          SPECIAL CASES:
                          * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `pickupHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday pickup hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                          SPECIAL CASES:
                          * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `seniorHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday senior hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                          SPECIAL CASES:
                          * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                          Contains the daily takeout hours, holiday takeout hours, and reopen date for the Entity.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `takeoutHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday takeout hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                          SPECIAL CASES:
                          * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

            This parameter represents one or more filtering conditions that are applied to the set of entities that would otherwise be returned. This parameter should be provided as a URL-encoded string containing a JSON object.

            For example, if the filter JSON is `{"name":{"$eq":"John"}}`, then the filter param after URL-encoding will be: `filter=%7B%22name%22%3A%7B%22%24eq%22%3A%22John%22%7D%7D`

            **Basic Filter Structure**

            The filter object at its core consists of a *matcher*, a *field*, and an *argument*.

            For example, in the following filter JSON:

            ```
            {
              "name":{
                "$eq":"John"
              }
            }
            ```

            `$eq` is the *matcher*, or filtering operation (equals, in this example),

            `name` is the *field* being filtered by, and

            `John` is *value* to be matched against.

            **Combining Multiple Filters**

            Multiple filters can be combined into one object using *combinators*. For example, the following filter JSON combines multiple filters using the combinator `$and`. `$or` is also supported.
            ```
            {
              "$and":[
                {
                  "firstName":{
                    "$eq":"John"
                  }
                },
                {
                  "countryCode":{
                    "$in":[
                      "US",
                      "GB"
                    ]
                  }
                }
              ]
            }
            ```

            **Filter Negation**

            Certain filter types may be negated. For example:

            ```
            {
              "$not" {
                "name":{
                  "$eq":"John"
                }
              }
            }
            ```

            This can also be written more simply with a `!` in the `$eq` parameter. The following filter would have the same effect:

            ```
            {
              "name":{
                "!$eq":"John"
              }
            }
            ```

            **Filter Complement**

            You can also search for the complement of a filter. This filter would match entities that do not contain "hello" in their descriptions, or do not have a description set. This is different from negation which can only match entities who have the negated field set to something.

            ```
            {
              "$complement":{
                "description":{
                  "$contains":"hello"
                }
              }
            }
            ```

            **Addressing Subfields**

            Subfields of fields can be addressed using the "dot" notation while filtering. For example, if you have a custom field called **`c_myCustomField`**:

            ```
            {
              "c_myCustomField":{
                "age": 30,
                "name": "Jim",
              }
            }
            ```

            While filtering, subfields may be addressed using the "dot" notation.

            ```
            {
              "c_myCustomField.name":{
                "!$eq":"John"
              }
            }
            ```

            Fields that are nested deeper may be addressed using dot notation, as well. For example, if **`name`** in the above example was a compound field with two subfields **`first`** and **`last`**, **`first`** may be addressed as **`c_myCustomField.name.first`**.

            **Field Support**

            Entity fields correspond to certain filter types, which support matchers. Going by the example above, the field **`name`** supports the `TEXT` filter type, which supports `$eq` (equals) and `$startsWith` (starts with).

            **TEXT**

            The `TEXT` filter type is supported for text fields. (e.g., **`name`**, **`countryCode`**)

            <table style="width:100%">
              <tr>
                <th>Matcher</th>
                <th>Details</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$eq (equals)</th>
                <th>

                {
                  "countryCode":{
                    "$eq":"US"
                  }
                },
                {
                  "countryCode":{
                    "!$eq":"US"
                  }
                }

              Supports negation. Case insensitive.
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$startsWith</th>
                <th>

              Matches if the field starts with the argument value.

              e.g., "Amazing" starts with "amaz"

                {
                   "address.line1":{
                      "$startsWith": "Jo"
                   }
                }

              Supports negation. Case insensitive.
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$in</th>
                <th>

              Matches if field value is a member of the argument list.

                {
                  "firstName":{
                    "$in": ["John", "Jimmy"]
                  }
                }

              Does not support negation. Negation can be mimicked by using an "OR" matcher, for example:

                {
                  "$and":[
                    {
                      "firstName":{
                        "!$eq": "John"
                      }
                    },
                    {
                      "firstName":{

              This filter will match if "sample" is contained in any string within **`c_myString`**.

              Note that this matching is "left-edge n-gram", meaning the argument string must be the beginning of a token. The string "sample" will match strings like "This a sample", "Sample one", and "Sample 2", but not strings like "thisisasamplewithoutspaces".

              Supports negation.

              This filter will match if either "sample1" or "sample2" is contained in any string within **`c_myString`**. The argument list can contain more than two strings.

              Note that this matching is "left-edge n-gram", meaning the argument string must be the beginning of a token. The string "sample" will match strings like "This a sample", "Sample one", and "Sample 2", but not strings like "thisisasamplewithoutspaces".

              This filter will match if both "sample1" and "sample2" are contained in any string within **`c_myString`**. The argument list can contain more than two strings.

              Note that this matching is "left-edge n-gram", meaning the argument string must be the beginning of a token. The string "sample" will match strings like "This a sample", "Sample one", and "Sample 2", but not strings like "thisisasamplewithoutspaces".

            </table>

            **BOOLEAN**


            The BOOLEAN filter type is supported for boolean fields and Yes / No custom fields.
            <table style="width:100%">
              <tr>
                <th>Matcher</th>

                    "$eq": true
                  }
                }

              For booleans, the filter takes a boolean value, not a string.
              Supports negation.
              </tr>
            </table>

            **STRUCT**

            The STRUCT filter type is supported for compound fields with subfields.

            *e.g., **`address`**, **`featuredMessage`**, fields of custom types*

            <table style="width:100%">
              <tr>
                <th>Matcher</th>

              <tr>
                <th>$hasProperty</th>
                <th>

              Matches if argument is a key (subfield) of field being filtered by. This filter type is useful for filtering by compound fields or to check if certain fields have a value set.

                {
                  "address": {
                    "$hasProperty": "line1"
                  }
                }

              Note that if a given property of a compound field is not set, the filter will not match. For example, if `line1` of **`address`** is not set for an entity, then the above matcher will not match the entity.

              Supports negation.

              </tr>
            </table>

            **OPTION**

            The OPTION filter type is supported for options custom fields and fields that have a predetermined list of valid values.

             *e.g., **`eventStatus`**, **`gender`**, `SINGLE_OPTION` and `MULTI_OPTION` types of custom fields.*

            <table style="width:100%">
              <tr>
                <th>Matcher</th>
                <th>Details</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$eq</th>
                <th>

              Matching is case insensitive and insensitive to consecutive whitespace.

              e.g., "XYZ 123" matches "xyz       123"

                {
                  "eventStatus": {
                    "$eq": "SCHEDULED"
                  }
                }

              Supports negation. Negating `$eq` on the list will match any field that does not hold any of the provided values.

              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$in</th>

                    ]
                  }
                }

              Does not support negation. However, negation can be mimicked by using an `$and` matcher to negate individually over the desired values. For example:

                {
                  "$and": [
                    {
                      "eventStatus":{
                        "!$eq": "SCHEDULED"
                      }
                    },
                    {
                      "firstName":{
                        "!$eq": "POSTPONED"
                      }
                    }

              </tr>
            </table>

            **PHONE**

            The PHONE filter type is supported for phone number fields only. PHONE will support the same matchers as TEXT, except that for `$eq`, the same phone number with or without calling code will match.

            <table style="width:100%">
              <tr>

              <tr>
                <th>$startsWith</th>
                <th>

              Matches if the field starts with the argument value.

              e.g., "8187076189" starts with "818"

                {

              <tr>
                <th>$in</th>
                <th>

              Matches if field value is a member of the argument list.

                {
                  "mainPhone":{

            **INTEGER, FLOAT, DATE, DATETIME, and TIME**

            These filter types are strictly ordered -- therefore, they support the following matchers:
            - Equals
            - Less Than / Less Than or Equal To
            - Greater Than / Greater Than or Equal To

              This filter will match if "sample" is contained in any string within **`c_myStringList`**.

              Note that this matching is "left edge n-gram", meaning the argument string must be the beginning of a token. The string "sample" will match strings like "This is a sample", "Sample one", "Sample 2" but not strings like "thisisasamplewithoutspaces".

              Supports negation.

              This filter will match if either "sample1" or "sample2" is contained in any string within **`c_myStringList`**. The argument list can have more than two strings.

              Note that similar to `$contains`, the matching for `$containsAny` is "left edge n-gram", meaning the argument string must be the beginning of a token. The string "sample" will match strings like "This is a sample", "Sample one", "Sample 2" but not strings like "thisisasamplewithoutspaces".

              Supports negation.

              Note that similar to `$contains`, the matching for `$containsAll` is "left-edge n-gram", meaning the argument string must be the beginning of a token. The string "sample" will match strings like "This a sample", "Sample one", and "Sample 2", but not strings like "thisisasamplewithoutspaces".

              Supports negation.

            **LIST OF STRUCT**

            Filtering on lists of struct types is a bit nuanced. Filtering can only be done on lists of structs of the SAME type.
            For example, if **`c_myStructList`** is a list of compound fields with the subfields **`age`** and **`name`**, then one can address the **`age`** properties of each field in **`c_myStructList`** as a flattened list of integers and filtering upon them. For example, the following filter:

            ```
            {
              "c_myStructList.age":{
                "$eq": 20
              }
            }
            ```

            will match if any field in the list has an **`age`** property equal to 20. Similarly, any filter that can be applied to lists of integers could be applied to **`age`** in this case (`$eq`, `$eqAll`, `$eqAny`).


            **HOURS**

            By filtering on an hours field, you can find which entities are open or closed at a specified time or during a certain time range. All of these filters also take an entity’s holiday hours and reopen date into account.

            <table style="width:100%">

              This filter would match entities open for the entire 24 hour period on 2019-05-10.

            **Filtering by Dates and Times**

            **Time zones**

            The filtering language supports searching both in local time and within a certain time zone. Searching in local time will simply ignore the time zone on the target entities, while providing one will convert the zone of your queried time to the zone of the target entities.

            To search in local time, simply provide the date or time without any zone: `2019-06-07T15:30` or `2019-06-07`.

            To conduct a zoned search, provide the name of the time zone in brackets after the time, as it is shown in the tz database: `2019-06-07T15:30[America/New_York]` or `2019-06-06[America/Phoenix]`.


            **Date and time types**

            In addition to searching with dates and datetimes, you can also query with years, months, and hours. For example, the filter:

            ```
            {
              "time.start": {
                "$eq": "2018"
              }
            }
            ```

            would match all start times in the year 2018. The same logic would apply for a month (`2019-05`), a date (`2019-05-01`), or an hour (`2019-05-01T06`).

            These types also work with ordered searches. For example:

            ```
            {
             "time.start": {
                "$lt": "2018"
             }
            }
            ```

            would match start times before 2018 (i.e., anything in 2017 or before). On the other hand, the same query with a `$le` matcher would include anything in or before 2018.

            **"Now" and Date Math**

            Instead of providing a static date or time, you can also use `now` in place of any date time. When you do so, the system will calculate the time when the query is made and conduct a zoned search.

            In order to search for a future or past time relative to `now`, you can use date math. For example, you can enter `now+3h` or `now-1d`, which would mean 3 hours from now and 1 day ago, respectively. You can also add and subtract minutes (`m`), months (`M`), and years (`y`).

            It is also possible to add or subtract time from a static date or datetime. Simply add `||` between the static value and any addition or subtraction. For example, `2019-02-03||+1d` would be the same as `2019-02-04`.

            You can also convert date and time types to other types. For example, to convert the datetime `2019-05-06T22:15` to a date, use `2019-05-06T22:15||/d`. Doing so would yield the same result as using `2019-05-06`. This method also works with `now`: `now/d` will give you today’s date without the time.

            **Filtering Across an Entity**

            It is possible to search for a specific text string across all fields of an entity by using the `$anywhere` matcher.

            <table style="width:100%">
              <tr>
                <th>Matcher</th>
                <th>Details</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$anywhere</th>
                <th>

              Matches if the argument text appears anywhere in the entity (including subfields, structs, and lists)

                {
                  "$anywhere": "hello"
                }

              This filter will match all entities that contain the string "hello" or strings that begin with "hello".

              </tr>
            </table>

            **Examples**

            The following filter will match against entities that:
            - Are of type `event` (note that entity types can also be filtered by the **`entityTypes`** query parameter)
            - Have a name that starts with the text "Century"
            - Have a maximum age between 10 and 20
            - Have a minimum age between 5 and 7
            - Start after 7 PM (19:00) on August 28, 2018

            ```
            {
              "$and":[
                {
                  "entityType":{
                    "$eq":"event"
                  }
                },
                {
                  "name":{

                                Similarly, holiday access hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.

                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Contains the daily brunch hours, holiday brunch hours, and reopen date for the Entity.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `brunchHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday brunch hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `deliveryHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday delivery hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `driveThroughHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday drive-through hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `happyHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday happy hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `hours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `kitchenHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday kitchen hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `onlineServiceHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday online service hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `pickupHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday pickup hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `seniorHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday senior hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Contains the daily takeout hours, holiday takeout hours, and reopen date for the Entity.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `takeoutHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday takeout hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                          Contains the daily access hours, holiday access hours, and reopen date for the Entity.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `accessHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday access hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                          SPECIAL CASES:
                          * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `brunchHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.

                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `deliveryHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday delivery hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                          SPECIAL CASES:
                          * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                          Contains the daily drive-through hours, holiday drive-through hours, and reopen date for the Entity.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `driveThroughHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday drive-through hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                          SPECIAL CASES:
                          * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                              For example, if the user sets the Facebook Call-to-Action as " 'Sign Up' using 'Website URL' " in the Yext platform, **`type`** will be `SIGN_UP` and **`value`** will be `[[websiteUrl]]`.

                              The Call-to-Action will have the same behavior if the user sets the value to "Custom Value" in the platform and embeds a field.

                          Contains the daily happy hours, holiday happy hours, and reopen date for the Entity.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `happyHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday happy hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                          SPECIAL CASES:
                          * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `hours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                          SPECIAL CASES:
                          * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `kitchenHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday kitchen hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                          SPECIAL CASES:
                          * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                          Contains the daily online service hours, holiday online service hours, and reopen date for the Entity.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `onlineServiceHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday online service hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                          SPECIAL CASES:
                          * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `pickupHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday pickup hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                          SPECIAL CASES:
                          * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `seniorHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday senior hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                          SPECIAL CASES:
                          * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                          Contains the daily takeout hours, holiday takeout hours, and reopen date for the Entity.

                          Each day is represented by a sub-field of `takeoutHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                          Similarly, holiday takeout hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                          Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                          SPECIAL CASES:
                          * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                          * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                          * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `accessHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday access hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `brunchHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday brunch hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `deliveryHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday delivery hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Contains the daily drive-through hours, holiday drive-through hours, and reopen date for the Entity.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `driveThroughHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday drive-through hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                    For example, if the user sets the Facebook Call-to-Action as " 'Sign Up' using 'Website URL' " in the Yext platform, **`type`** will be `SIGN_UP` and **`value`** will be `[[websiteUrl]]`.

                                    The Call-to-Action will have the same behavior if the user sets the value to "Custom Value" in the platform and embeds a field.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `happyHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday happy hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Similarly, holiday hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `kitchenHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday kitchen hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Contains the daily online service hours, holiday online service hours, and reopen date for the Entity.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `onlineServiceHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday online service hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `pickupHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday pickup hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `seniorHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday senior hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                Each day is represented by a sub-field of `takeoutHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                Similarly, holiday takeout hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                SPECIAL CASES:
                                * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

            This parameter represents one or more filtering conditions that are applied to the set of entities that would otherwise be returned. This parameter should be provided as a URL-encoded string containing a JSON object.

            For example, if the filter JSON is `{"name":{"$eq":"John"}}`, then the filter param after URL-encoding will be: `filter=%7B%22name%22%3A%7B%22%24eq%22%3A%22John%22%7D%7D`

            **Basic Filter Structure**

            The filter object at its core consists of a *matcher*, a *field*, and an *argument*.

            For example, in the following filter JSON:

            ```
            {
              "name":{
                "$eq":"John"
              }
            }
            ```

            `$eq` is the *matcher*, or filtering operation (equals, in this example),

            `name` is the *field* being filtered by, and

            `John` is *value* to be matched against.

            **Combining Multiple Filters**

            Multiple filters can be combined into one object using *combinators*. For example, the following filter JSON combines multiple filters using the combinator `$and`. `$or` is also supported.
            ```
            {
              "$and":[
                {
                  "firstName":{
                    "$eq":"John"
                  }
                },
                {
                  "countryCode":{
                    "$in":[
                      "US",
                      "GB"
                    ]
                  }
                }
              ]
            }
            ```

            **Filter Negation**

            Certain filter types may be negated. For example:

            ```
            {
              "$not" {
                "name":{
                  "$eq":"John"
                }
              }
            }
            ```

            This can also be written more simply with a `!` in the `$eq` parameter. The following filter would have the same effect:

            ```
            {
              "name":{
                "!$eq":"John"
              }
            }
            ```

            **Filter Complement**

            You can also search for the complement of a filter. This filter would match entities that do not contain "hello" in their descriptions, or do not have a description set. This is different from negation which can only match entities who have the negated field set to something.

            ```
            {
              "$complement":{
                "description":{
                  "$contains":"hello"
                }
              }
            }
            ```

            **Addressing Subfields**

            Subfields of fields can be addressed using the "dot" notation while filtering. For example, if you have a custom field called **`c_myCustomField`**:

            ```
            {
              "c_myCustomField":{
                "age": 30,
                "name": "Jim",
              }
            }
            ```

            While filtering, subfields may be addressed using the "dot" notation.

            ```
            {
              "c_myCustomField.name":{
                "!$eq":"John"
              }
            }
            ```

            Fields that are nested deeper may be addressed using dot notation, as well. For example, if **`name`** in the above example was a compound field with two subfields **`first`** and **`last`**, **`first`** may be addressed as **`c_myCustomField.name.first`**.

            **Field Support**

            Entity fields correspond to certain filter types, which support matchers. Going by the example above, the field **`name`** supports the `TEXT` filter type, which supports `$eq` (equals) and `$startsWith` (starts with).

            **TEXT**

            The `TEXT` filter type is supported for text fields. (e.g., **`name`**, **`countryCode`**)

            <table style="width:100%">
              <tr>
                <th>Matcher</th>
                <th>Details</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$eq (equals)</th>
                <th>

                {
                  "countryCode":{
                    "$eq":"US"
                  }
                },
                {
                  "countryCode":{
                    "!$eq":"US"

              <tr>
                <th>$startsWith</th>
                <th>

              Matches if the field starts with the argument value.

              e.g., "Amazing" starts with "amaz"

                {
                   "address.line1":{
                      "$startsWith": "Jo"
                   }
                }

              Supports negation. Case insensitive.
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$in</th>
                <th>

              Matches if field value is a member of the argument list.

                {
                  "firstName":{
                    "$in": ["John", "Jimmy"]
                  }
                }

              Does not support negation. Negation can be mimicked by using an "OR" matcher, for example:

                {
                  "$and":[
                    {
                      "firstName":{

                    },
                    {
                      "firstName":{
                        "!$eq": "Jimmy"
                      }
                    }
                  ]
                }

              </tr>
              <tr>

                    "$contains":"sample"
                  }
                }

              This filter will match if "sample" is contained in any string within **`c_myString`**.

              Note that this matching is "left-edge n-gram", meaning the argument string must be the beginning of a token. The string "sample" will match strings like "This a sample", "Sample one", and "Sample 2", but not strings like "thisisasamplewithoutspaces".

              Supports negation.

                    ]
                  }
                }

              This filter will match if either "sample1" or "sample2" is contained in any string within **`c_myString`**. The argument list can contain more than two strings.

              Note that this matching is "left-edge n-gram", meaning the argument string must be the beginning of a token. The string "sample" will match strings like "This a sample", "Sample one", and "Sample 2", but not strings like "thisisasamplewithoutspaces".

              This filter will match if both "sample1" and "sample2" are contained in any string within **`c_myString`**. The argument list can contain more than two strings.

              Note that this matching is "left-edge n-gram", meaning the argument string must be the beginning of a token. The string "sample" will match strings like "This a sample", "Sample one", and "Sample 2", but not strings like "thisisasamplewithoutspaces".

              Supports negation.

            </table>

            **BOOLEAN**


            The BOOLEAN filter type is supported for boolean fields and Yes / No custom fields.
            <table style="width:100%">
              <tr>
                <th>Matcher</th>

                    "$eq": true
                  }
                }

              For booleans, the filter takes a boolean value, not a string.
              Supports negation.
              </tr>
            </table>

            **STRUCT**

            The STRUCT filter type is supported for compound fields with subfields.

            *e.g., **`address`**, **`featuredMessage`**, fields of custom types*

            <table style="width:100%">
              <tr>
                <th>Matcher</th>
                <th>Details</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$hasProperty</th>
                <th>

              Matches if argument is a key (subfield) of field being filtered by. This filter type is useful for filtering by compound fields or to check if certain fields have a value set.

                {
                  "address": {
                    "$hasProperty": "line1"
                  }
                }

              Note that if a given property of a compound field is not set, the filter will not match. For example, if `line1` of **`address`** is not set for an entity, then the above matcher will not match the entity.

              Supports negation.

              </tr>
            </table>

            **OPTION**

            The OPTION filter type is supported for options custom fields and fields that have a predetermined list of valid values.

             *e.g., **`eventStatus`**, **`gender`**, `SINGLE_OPTION` and `MULTI_OPTION` types of custom fields.*

            <table style="width:100%">
              <tr>
                <th>Matcher</th>
                <th>Details</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$eq</th>
                <th>

              Matching is case insensitive and insensitive to consecutive whitespace.

              e.g., "XYZ 123" matches "xyz       123"

                {
                  "eventStatus": {
                    "$eq": "SCHEDULED"
                  }
                }

              Supports negation. Negating `$eq` on the list will match any field that does not hold any of the provided values.

              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$in</th>

                      "SCHEDULED",
                      "POSTPONED"
                    ]
                  }
                }

              Does not support negation. However, negation can be mimicked by using an `$and` matcher to negate individually over the desired values. For example:

                {
                  "$and": [
                    {
                      "eventStatus":{
                        "!$eq": "SCHEDULED"
                      }
                    },
                    {
                      "firstName":{
                        "!$eq": "POSTPONED"
                      }
                    }
                  ]
                }

              </tr>
            </table>

            **PHONE**

            The PHONE filter type is supported for phone number fields only. PHONE will support the same matchers as TEXT, except that for `$eq`, the same phone number with or without calling code will match.

            <table style="width:100%">
              <tr>

              <tr>
                <th>$startsWith</th>
                <th>

              Matches if the field starts with the argument value.

              e.g., "8187076189" starts with "818"

                {

            **INTEGER, FLOAT, DATE, DATETIME, and TIME**

            These filter types are strictly ordered -- therefore, they support the following matchers:
            - Equals
            - Less Than / Less Than or Equal To
            - Greater Than / Greater Than or Equal To

              Note that this matching is "left edge n-gram", meaning the argument string must be the beginning of a token. The string "sample" will match strings like "This is a sample", "Sample one", "Sample 2" but not strings like "thisisasamplewithoutspaces".

              Supports negation.

            **LIST OF STRUCT**

            Filtering on lists of struct types is a bit nuanced. Filtering can only be done on lists of structs of the SAME type.
            For example, if **`c_myStructList`** is a list of compound fields with the subfields **`age`** and **`name`**, then one can address the **`age`** properties of each field in **`c_myStructList`** as a flattened list of integers and filtering upon them. For example, the following filter:

            ```
            {
              "c_myStructList.age":{
                "$eq": 20
              }
            }
            ```

            will match if any field in the list has an **`age`** property equal to 20. Similarly, any filter that can be applied to lists of integers could be applied to **`age`** in this case (`$eq`, `$eqAll`, `$eqAny`).


            **HOURS**

            By filtering on an hours field, you can find which entities are open or closed at a specified time or during a certain time range. All of these filters also take an entity’s holiday hours and reopen date into account.

            <table style="width:100%">

            **Filtering by Dates and Times**

            **Time zones**

            The filtering language supports searching both in local time and within a certain time zone. Searching in local time will simply ignore the time zone on the target entities, while providing one will convert the zone of your queried time to the zone of the target entities.

            To search in local time, simply provide the date or time without any zone: `2019-06-07T15:30` or `2019-06-07`.

            To conduct a zoned search, provide the name of the time zone in brackets after the time, as it is shown in the tz database: `2019-06-07T15:30[America/New_York]` or `2019-06-06[America/Phoenix]`.


            **Date and time types**

            In addition to searching with dates and datetimes, you can also query with years, months, and hours. For example, the filter:

            ```
            {
              "time.start": {
                "$eq": "2018"
              }
            }
            ```

            would match all start times in the year 2018. The same logic would apply for a month (`2019-05`), a date (`2019-05-01`), or an hour (`2019-05-01T06`).

            These types also work with ordered searches. For example:

            ```
            {
             "time.start": {
                "$lt": "2018"
             }
            }
            ```

            would match start times before 2018 (i.e., anything in 2017 or before). On the other hand, the same query with a `$le` matcher would include anything in or before 2018.

            **"Now" and Date Math**

            Instead of providing a static date or time, you can also use `now` in place of any date time. When you do so, the system will calculate the time when the query is made and conduct a zoned search.

            In order to search for a future or past time relative to `now`, you can use date math. For example, you can enter `now+3h` or `now-1d`, which would mean 3 hours from now and 1 day ago, respectively. You can also add and subtract minutes (`m`), months (`M`), and years (`y`).

            It is also possible to add or subtract time from a static date or datetime. Simply add `||` between the static value and any addition or subtraction. For example, `2019-02-03||+1d` would be the same as `2019-02-04`.

            You can also convert date and time types to other types. For example, to convert the datetime `2019-05-06T22:15` to a date, use `2019-05-06T22:15||/d`. Doing so would yield the same result as using `2019-05-06`. This method also works with `now`: `now/d` will give you today’s date without the time.

            **Filtering Across an Entity**

            It is possible to search for a specific text string across all fields of an entity by using the `$anywhere` matcher.

            <table style="width:100%">
              <tr>
                <th>Matcher</th>
                <th>Details</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>$anywhere</th>
                <th>

              Matches if the argument text appears anywhere in the entity (including subfields, structs, and lists)

                {
                  "$anywhere": "hello"
                }

              This filter will match all entities that contain the string "hello" or strings that begin with "hello".

              </tr>
            </table>

            **Examples**

            The following filter will match against entities that:
            - Are of type `event` (note that entity types can also be filtered by the **`entityTypes`** query parameter)
            - Have a name that starts with the text "Century"
            - Have a maximum age between 10 and 20
            - Have a minimum age between 5 and 7
            - Start after 7 PM (19:00) on August 28, 2018

            ```

            A list of fields and sort directions to order results by. Each ordering in the list should be in the format `{"field_name", "sort_direction"}`, where `sort_direction` is either `ASCENDING` or `DESCENDING`.

            For example, to order by `name` the sort order would be `[{"name":"ASCENDING"}]`. To order by `name` and then `description`, the sort order would be `[{"name":"ASCENDING"},{"description":"ASCENDING"}]`.

                                      Each day is represented by a sub-field of `accessHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                      Similarly, holiday access hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                      Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                                      * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                      * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                      Contains the daily brunch hours, holiday brunch hours, and reopen date for the Entity.

                                      Each day is represented by a sub-field of `brunchHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                      Similarly, holiday brunch hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                      Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                      SPECIAL CASES:
                                      * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                      * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                      * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                      Contains the daily delivery hours, holiday delivery hours, and reopen date for the Entity.

                                      Each day is represented by a sub-field of `deliveryHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                      Similarly, holiday delivery hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                      Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                      SPECIAL CASES:
                                      * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                      * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                      * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                      Each day is represented by a sub-field of `driveThroughHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                      Similarly, holiday drive-through hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                      Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                                      * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                      * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                      Contains the daily happy hours, holiday happy hours, and reopen date for the Entity.

                                      Each day is represented by a sub-field of `happyHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                      Similarly, holiday happy hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                      Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                      SPECIAL CASES:
                                      * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                      * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                      * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                      Each day is represented by a sub-field of `hours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                      Similarly, holiday hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                      Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                                      * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                      * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                      Similarly, holiday kitchen hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                      Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                                      * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                      * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                      Similarly, holiday online service hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                      Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                                      * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                      * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                      Similarly, holiday pickup hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                      Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                      SPECIAL CASES:
                                      * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                      * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                      * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                      Each day is represented by a sub-field of `seniorHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
                                      Similarly, holiday senior hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                      Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
                                      SPECIAL CASES:
                                      * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
                                      * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                      * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

                                      Similarly, holiday takeout hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
                                      Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.

                                      * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on a specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply two or more `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
                                      * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.

        List records from a Content Endpoint

        Content API provides the ability for a user to filter and sort records
        by the contents of an indexed field. The filters and sorting parameters can
        be provided as query parameters, in addition to the query parameters
        documented here. If no filters are provided, the API returns all the records
        (with pagination).

        For example, with the parameter **`name=Alice`**, only records where the
        field **`name`** has value **`Alice`** will be returned.

        Similarly, adding the parameters **`name__in=Alice`** and **`name__in=Bob`**
        will result in records with **`name`** equal to **`Alice`** OR **`name`**
        equal to **`Bob`** being returned.

        ### Filters

        Filters are supported on Text, Numeric, Date and DateTime fields, although
        not all filters are supported by all fields. It is also possible to filter
        on an array of strings, or a string field nested in an array of objects. In
        this case, the record will be present in the response if one of the field
        values in the array matches the filter.

        Multiple filters on different fields and different filter types can be
        combined in the same query. An indexed field with an object can be filtered
        by using the dot notation, for example, **`address.city=Brooklyn`**.

        A number of different types of filters are supported.

        #### Equals

        This can be specified as simple query parameter.

        Supported Types: Text, Numeric, Date, DateTime, Fields within Arrays.

        *Example:*
        Adding **`&name=Alice`** as a query parameter will return records where the
        name field matches Alice.


        #### Not Equals

        This can be specified with the **`neq`** modifier to the query parameter
        key.

        Supported Types: Text, Numeric, Date, DateTime, Fields within Arrays.

        *Example:*
        Adding **`&name__neq=Alice`** as a query parameter will return records where
        the name field does not match Alice.

        #### Equals Any Of

        This is basically an `OR` clause for Equals on a given field. This can be
        specified with the **`in`** modifier to the query parameter key.

        Supported Types: Text, Numeric, Date, DateTime, Fields within Arrays.

        *Example:*
        Adding **`&name__in=Alice&name__in=Bob`** as a query parameter will return
        records where the name field matches either Alice or Bob.

        #### Comparison

        The following comparison filters are supported:
        * Greater Than with the modifier `gt`
        * Greater Than Or Equals with the modifier `gte`
        * Less Than with the modifier `lt`
        * Less Than Or Equals with the modifier `lte`

        Supported Types: Numeric, Date, DateTime.

        *Example:*
        Adding **`&createdDate__gt=2020-11-11&rating__gte=4`** as a query parameter
        will return records where the `createdDate` is after `2020-11-11` and the
        `rating` field has a value greater than or equal to `4`.

        #### GeoSearch

        Supports filtering to records for which the specified field is within the supplied radius to the supplied latitude and longitude. 

        Supported Types: Coordinates (ex: `yextDisplayCoordinate`, `displayCoordinate`, etc.).

        GeoSearch queries are constructed by appending a `__geo` comparator to a coordinate field in the request. The details of the GeoSearch must then be included, comma separated, as part of the query value, optionally surrounded by parantheses. 

        The following parameters are supported:
        * The latitude of the point to geosearch from, specified as `lat`
        * The longitude of the point to geosearch from, specified as `lon`
        * The numeric radius from the point which results will be filtered to, specifed as `radius`
        * The unit of measurement for the radius, specified as `unit`. One of `km`, `mi`, `m`, `ft`. Defaults to `mi`

        *Example:*
        Adding **`&yextDisplayCoordinate__geo=(lat:40.740,lon:-73.987565,radius:50,unit:km)`** as a query parameter
        will return records where the `yextDisplayCoordinate` field on the entities is within 50 km of the provided latitude and longitude.

        Like all other filters, the field which is being geosearched upon must be specified in the `fieldIndexes` of the endpoint definition. 

        ### Sorting

        Content Endpoints support sorting by an indexed field. This can be enabled
        by adding the `$sortBy` query parameter with field name as the value.
        Optionally, the modifiers `asc` and `desc` can be added to indicate
        sorting by ascending and descending orders respectively. If no modifier is
        specified, the results will be returned in descending order.

        Currently, sorting is only supported on a single field per request.

        *Example:*
        Adding **`&$sortBy__desc=createdDate`** as a query parameter will return
        records with the most recent `createdDate` first.

        ### Additional Notes on Supported Types

        Indexes are supported on String, Numeric, Date and DateTime types. The set
        of supported filters for each type is documented in the previous section.

        #### String

        Content Endpoints support indexing UTF-8 strings with a maximum length of
        256 characters.

        #### Date and DateTime

        * The timezone information on a DateTime, if present, will be stripped away
        during indexing, without converting the time to another timezone.
        * For indexing, the system expects to get [RFC3339 DateTime
        format](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) for DateTimes and
        `YYYY-MM-DD` for Dates.
        * For querying, API accepts the following formats: `YYYY-MM-DD`,
        `YYYY-MM-DDTHH`, `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` and `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`.

    filters:

        A set of filters that is applied to the set of locations that would otherwise be returned. Should be provided as a URL-encoded string containing a JSON array. The array should have one or more filter objects defined. All filter objects will apply as an intersection (i.e., AND). Field names reference Location fields, as well as custom fields using the format `custom###`, where "###" is the custom field’s **`id`**.

        For example, to provide a filter that would match location names containing the word "gourmet", the filter parameter would be `[{"name":{"contains":["gourmet"]}}]`, which URL-encoded would be `%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%7B%22contains%22%3A%5B%22gourmet%22%5D%7D%7D%5D`.

        NOTE: "x", "xx", and "xxx" are reserved keywords that, when passed in a `contains` matcher for a Full or Text filter, will cause that filter to match on all locations.

        The filter types are the following. Note there may be multiple available specifications for a given filter type:

        type: string
      description: |
        Specifies the fields and direction by which the output should be sorted. Should be provided as a URL-encoded string containing a JSON array of `sortDefinition` objects. A `sortDefinition` object consists of a `sortField` and a `sortDirection` field. The `sortField` is the name of the field you are sorting by (e.g., `firstName` or `custom###` for a custom field, where "###" is the custom field’s **`id`**). The `sortDirection` indicates whether the sort is ascending (`ASCENDING`) or descending (`DESCENDING`).

        For example, to sort by last name ascending and first name descending, this parameter would be `[{"sortField":"lastName","sortDirection":"ASCENDING"},{"sortField":"firstName", "sortDirection":"DESCENDING"}]`, which, when URL-encoded, would be `%5B%7B%22sortField%22%3A%22lastName%22%2C%22sortDirection%22%3A%22ASCENDING%22%7D%2C%7B%22sortField%22%3A%22firstName%22%2C%22sortDirection%22%3A%22DESCENDING%22%7D%5D`.

        **NOTE:** Currently, we support sorting by **`firstName`**, **`lastName`**, and text custom fields.

        1) Latitude and Longitude: The latitude and longitude of the point, separated by a comma (e.g.`"40.740957,-73.987565"`),

        2) Address: A free-form address to geocode into a latitude and longitude (e.g., `"1 Madison Ave, New York, NY 10010"` or `"New York, NY"`).

        Note that providing an address that resolves to an area, like a city or a postal code, does not restrict the search to exactly that area; it simply centers the search circle on a point in that area.

        If both **`countryBias`** and **`geocoderBias`** are provided, **`geocoderBias`** is given priority, but both values are considered in the search.

            Hours should be submitted as a comma-separated list of days, where each day's hours are specified as follows:

            d:oh:om:ch:cm
            * d = day of the week –
              * 1 – Sunday
              * 2 – Monday
              * 3 – Tuesday
              * 4 – Wednesday
              * 5 – Thursday
              * 6 – Friday
              * 7 – Saturday
            * oh:om = opening time in 24-hour format
            * ch:cm = closing time in 24-hour format

            Times with single-digit hours (e.g., 9 AM) can be submitted with or without a leading zero (9:00 or 09:00).

            **Example:** open 9 AM to 5 PM Monday and Tuesday, open 10 AM to 4 PM on Saturday – 2:9:00:17:00,3:9:00:17:00,7:10:00:16:00

            SPECIAL CASES:
            * To indicate that a location is open 24 hours on a specific day, set 00:00 as both the opening and closing time for that day.
              * **Example:** open all day on Saturdays – 7:00:00:00:00
            * To indicate that a location is closed on a specific day, omit that day from the list or set it as closed ("closed" is not case sensitive).
              * **Example:** closed on Sundays – 1:closed
              * **NOTE:** If a location is closed seven days a week, set at least one day to closed. Otherwise, **hours** is an empty string, and we assume you are not submitting hours information for that location.
            * To indicate that a location has split hours on a specific day, submit a set of hours for each block of time the location is open.
              * **Example:** open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM on Mondays – 2:9:00:12:00,2:13:00:17:00

            **NOTE:** To set hours for specific days of the year rather than days of the week, use **holidayHours**.
